        "As the world is moving towards distributed systems, there continuous need for sharing data, resources or even softwares across different applications - without compromising on privacy, and maintain a layer of abstraction (user does not need to know internal implementation of the code) which makes them universally understandable, easy to use. This what API facilitates.\n",

        "Consider mobile banking applications where a user enters credentials and goes on to access account, do a transaction - here the mobile banking application acts as a client which is just a front end and the account information is in a database with a different server (back end). What allows this client to communicate with the server is the interface - API. These applications could be written in different langauges, what's interesting is API allows this dynamic communication to take place seamlessly.\n",

        "\n",
        "--\n",
        "\n",
        "Advantages:\n",
        "*   a disconnected front and back end: it allows developers to decouple the front end and back end. This works as both communicate via the API rather than directly with each other, thereby eliminating any dependencies they would have under a standard model. As a result, each end can be built completely independently, using its own tools and technologies depending on its individual requirements.\n",
        "*   Improved accessiblity: When APIs are placed front and center of the architecture strategy, it's much easier to ensure that everything else that surrounds these tools is compatible and accessible. Because components are built with the needs of the API in mind, there should be fewer instances where, for example, one part of a system formats data in a way that doesn't easily fit into other elements, which would otherwise require a costly and time-consuming workaround.\n",
        "*   Faster, more agile development: Another consequence of separating key front-end and back-end systems is that they can be developed independently without having to worry about issues such as how they will work together. This allows development teams to take a more flexible approach as they only have to concern themselves with maintaining compatibility with the API.\n",
        "*   Easier scalability: The modular approach that API-led architecture provides also gives companies the ability to plug in services as and when they're required and remove them in the same way, without needing to make any change to the app itself. It's therefore easier to scale solutions up or down to react to fluctuations in demand or add new functionality in response to user requirements.\n",
        "\n",
        "Disadvantages:\n",
        "*   Added management burden: The number of APIs used within businesses can quickly add up. Additionally, these will all need to be monitored and maintained, which can be a significant burden if done manually. Therefore, investing in API automation will be essential if firms are to cope with this sprawl. At the same time, APIs will require additional resources to support them, which will mean more investment in infrastructure.\n",
        "*   Security considerations: As APIs become more commonplace across all aspects of business, this will naturally lead to them coming to the attention of hackers. Unsecured APIs can offer another attack vector to criminals.\n",
